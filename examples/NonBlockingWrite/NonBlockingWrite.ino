/*
  Non-blocking Write

  This example demonstrates how to perform non-blocking writes
  to a file on a SD card. The file will contain the current millis()
  value every 10ms. If the SD card is busy, the data will be dataBuffered
  in order to not block the sketch.

  If data is successfully written, the built in LED will flash. After a few
  seconds, check the card for a file called datalog.txt

  NOTE: myFile.availableForWrite() will automatically sync the
        file contents as needed. You may lose some unsynced data
        still if myFile.sync() or myFile.close() is not called.
